# FCHC-GNN: Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper titled "Injecting Hierarchical Biological Priors into Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction" accepted at the ICML 2024 Workshop on Accessible and Efficient Foundation Models for Biological Discovery.

## Overview
Flow cytometry (FC) is a powerful technology that enables rapid multi-parametric analysis of single cells in solution. However, the complex hierarchical relationships and neighborhood interactions inherent in cellular processes pose significant challenges for traditional flat data representations. Our work proposes a novel hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, termed FCHC-GNN, that injects structured biological priors to enhance multi-class prediction on FC cellular data.
By encoding known hierarchical relationships between cell types and functional classes, our model effectively captures the rich dependencies innate to biological domains while operating on a tabular input representation. Extensive experiments across our real-world FC dataset demonstrate substantially improved performance over strong baselines that fail to leverage such hierarchical constraints.
